A collection of CircuitPython code for Bluetooth LE sniffing in service of Contact Tracing development

This repo is initially a collection of CircuitPython code, contributed by Dar Scott, which he has been using for sniffing Bluetooth LE packets using CircuitPython installed on an Adafruit module.

Here are some notes from Dar:


```
The .py files with all lower-case and no spaces are library files. Drop them into Volumes/CIRCUITPY/lib.

The "GAEN Sniffer.py" file should be saved as main.py in Volumes/CIRCUITPY. Any other .py should be removed. 

We might want to break that up into several programs. Right now it does everything.
```

Also included is a crypto file from James Petrie.

Sharing and contributions encouraged.
